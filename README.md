### Development
When creating the app, the first choice I made was that it was going to be a CLI game.

I then decided to write the program using Ruby, because of my familiarity with built in methods.

The first thing I worked on was the process of generating a single word leveraging the provided API. I used the Open URI gem to send a get request and receive a list of words. I then converted the response to a more useable array of words. I selected a random word from the array by generating a random number to use as the index.

Then I got to work on the user interaction aspect of getting input from the user as well as communicating the state of the game (guesses remaining, guessed letters). I then added visual representation of the state of the hidden word using underscores filling in the letters correctly guessed.

The above was done in a single page, so I started to separate the program into files that performed specific functions. I create a visuals file that held the visual aspect of the hangman and hidden word. I created the word_gen file to take care of generating words for the user to guess. This made it easier to work on the word generation process once Iâ€™d added configurable difficulty and the option to use phrases. The initial game logic I wrote at the beginning remained the same for the most part throughout the making of. I created the config.rb file to allow user to configure difficulty. I saved the game config in the form of a CSV file that is re written every time config.rb is run. The word generator runs based the settings found in settings.conf.

Finally I did some file/folder restructuring storing the game files in a folder called game. I only left the config, play_hangman, and README files at the top. Play hangman runs the game until the user no longer wishes to play.
